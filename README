Math::Currency - Exact Currency Math with Formatting and Rounding

This is a major rewrite to enable the use of Math::FixedPrecision for all math
functions instead of internal functions.  It has also been configured to try 
to use Locale formatting if it can, or US defaults if it cannot.  The format
setttings can be considered at best experimental.  I need a lot more data from
other countries to know if what I have done is suffient.  You are urged to use
explicit format values for your country, rather than relying on the built-in
system without further testing.

To install, do the usual:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

Please see the POD for usage instructions...
