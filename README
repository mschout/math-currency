Math::Currency - Exact Currency Math with Formatting and Rounding

This module uses Math::BigFloat for all math operations.  It permits
currency calculations without concern with floating point notation and
rounding issues.

This is a major release to maintain extended precision internally (an 
extra 2 digits) so that repeated multiplication/division by non-M::C
values will maintain appropriate accuracy.  See the POD for more details.

To install, do the following (as non-root):

        $ perl Build.PL
        $ ./Build
        $ ./Build test

You can alternately run

	$ ./Build test verbose=1

to see the actual tests being run, as well as some example outputs.

Then to install the module (as root):

        # ./Build install
