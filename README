Math::Currency - Exact Currency Math with Formatting and Rounding

This is a rewrite to enable the use of the new Math::BigFloat for all math
operations.  It has also been configured to try to use Locale formatting if it
can, or US defaults if it cannot.  The format settings can be considered at best
experimental.  I need a lot more data from other countries to know if what I have
done is suffient.  You are urged to use explicit format values for your country,
rather than relying on the built-in system without further testing.

To install, do the usual:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

NOTE:  You must install Math::BigFloat 1.27 before installing this module,
which is not currently part of the Perl core (it will be included with 5.6.2).
You can get Math::BigFloat as part of the Math::BigInt 1.49 distribution found
here:

	http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Math/Math-BigInt-1.49.tar.gz

or from your local CPAN site.
