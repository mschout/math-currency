Math::Currency - Exact Currency Math with Formatting and Rounding

This module uses Math::BigFloat for all math operations.  It permits
currency calculations without concern with floating point notation and
rounding issues.

This version has been completely rewritten to more fully support Locale
formatting, with special emphasis on the Euro.  There are possibly significant
API changes with regard to the format definitions.  In particular, all of
the locale formats are now implemented as subclasses, with a script
available for generating site specific subclasses for installation.  Please
see the POD for more details.

The module Math::Currency::Euro has been removed from the distribution as
of 0.41, due to there being no one standard formatting.  Please generate
your own Euro.pm module based on your own national $LANG setting using the
new_currency script.

This release has also been converted to use Module::Build, so to install, 
do the following (as non-root):

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
        ./Build test

You can alternately run

	./Build test verbose=1

to see the actual tests being run, as well as some example outputs.

Then to install the module (as root):

        ./Build install
