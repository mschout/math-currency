Math::Currency - Perl extension for performing exact currency math

This module has been in use internally for the last 3 months or so.
I was driven to write it because I needed to match the outstanding
Accounts Receivable balance to the penny when converting from one
warehouse distribution system to another.  If you have to work with
currency values, this module will probably save to a lot of heart-
burn trying to match things exactly (which the accountants are so
picky about ;).

The included documentation is sparse but probably adequate.  Do the
usual:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Based on feedback from other users, I will change or not change
the interface.  I would like to have a set of international formats
preprogrammed so that anyone can use it with little work.  You can
still do whatever you like now, it is just not as clever/pretty as
I would like.
