Math::Currency - Exact Currency Math with Formatting and Rounding

This module uses the new Math::BigFloat for all math operations.  It permits
currency calculations without concern with floating point notation and
rounding issues.

This version has been completely rewritten to more fully support Locale
formatting, with special emphasis on the Euro.  There are possibly significant
API changes with regard to the format definitions.  Please see the POD for
more details.

To install, do the usual (as non-root):

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test

You can alternately run

	make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

to see the actual tests being run, as well as some example outputs.

Then to install the module (as root):

        make install

NOTE:  If you are not running Perl 5.8.0, you must install at least Math::BigFloat 1.27 before
installing this module.  You can get Math::BigFloat as part of the Math::BigInt distribution
found on CPAN:
