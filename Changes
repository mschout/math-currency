	      object, reported by "Brian Phillips" <brianp@holmescorp.com>

	*   scripts/new_currency
	    lib/Math/Currency/GBP.pm

	*   lib/Math/Currency/EUR.pm
	      After looking at all of the possible EURO supported locales, with
	      their wildly differing formats, I've decided to just pull if from
	      the distro completely.

2005-10-26  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	*   lib/Math/Currency/EUR.pm
	    There seems to be some vast disagreement about what the correct
	    formatting should be for EURO.  This seems to be consistent with

	    generate correct code now
	    produce diagnostic output

	*   t/002_basic.t
	    Don't need warning since skip() works now
